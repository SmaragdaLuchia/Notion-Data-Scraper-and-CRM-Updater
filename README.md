## Data-Scraper-and-CRM-Updater

This project is a simple automation that lets you autofill company details in a Notion CRM.

It uses a Python script, hosted on Vercel, to scrape the Estonian Business Register. When you click a link on a Notion page, this script runs and automatically fills in the empty fields.
